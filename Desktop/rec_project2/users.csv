9,5.0,2022-03-04,"I'm very glad that I enrolled. I've already learned so much about Solana development, and I'm finally starting to understand what people mean when they talk about technologies like Web3/dapp etc. 

It's also useful that you learn a variety of ways to develop. You can develop from scratch, or with Rust, or with the terminal, or with JavaScript, or with certain Solana libraries like Metaplex, and Arjun covers all these different techniques in the course so you have a toolkit.

I'm hoping to pick up a blockchain developer gig in either Eithereum or Solana, and I'm thankful this course has given me the knowledge I need for Solana.",138

Like in testing the Teacher was running JS files with TS Mocha, which was running fine on his computer but not fine on mine. So please provide that tutorial in either JS or TS but do not MIX Them.

Also in smart contract. I do not know tests were running in dev net or localhost. please tell.",141
